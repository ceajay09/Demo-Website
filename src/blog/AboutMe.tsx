                <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                How did I begin my tech journey?<br/>
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body2">From a young age, I have been fascinated by the world of IT. 
                My experience as a working student at a renowned pharmaceutical company enhanced my 
                understanding of modern technologies and process optimization, deepening my interest 
                in the field. During my studies in Business Informatics, where I focused on programming 
                modules, I actively engaged in practical projects with companies as clients, eagerly 
                taking on responsibilities and applying theoretical knowledge in real-world settings.<br />
                  <br /></Typography>
                  <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                  What key skills have I developed?<br/>
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body2">This role allowed me to gain valuable experience and expand 
                my understanding of various programming languages through script writing. It also 
                deepened my interest in IT as I worked at the intersection of business and technology. 
                During my civil service in IT support, I acquired comprehensive knowledge about diverse 
                systems and their interactions, further solidifying my technical foundation. This 
                experience was particularly enriching during a ransomware attack, which provided 
                significant insights into how systems can interact and work together under crisis 
                scenarios.<br/>
                  <br /></Typography>
                  <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                  What motivates my continuous learning?<br/>
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body2">I regularly engage in private projects to explore new 
                technologies and consolidate my existing knowledge, like creating this webpage 
                using AWS to understand its functionalities in practice. I always strive to extend 
                my expertise by reading technical books, particularly on topics such as Design Patterns.
                 My journey in software development is not just about acquiring knowledge; it's about 
                 applying what I learn to solve real-world problems. I am constantly seeking 
                 opportunities to grow professionally and take on responsibilities in specific areas of 
                 expertise.<br/><br/></Typography>
                 <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
                 What are my career goals?<br/>
                </Typography>
                 <Typography variant="body2">I am eager to work in dynamic environments that drive 
                 innovation, bringing my technical skills, creativity, and team collaboration 
                 abilities to make a substantial impact. I look forward to contributing to meaningful 
                 projects that propel innovation and make a difference. Let's embark on this journey 
                 together and explore how we can create innovative solutions that shape the 
                 future.</Typography>
